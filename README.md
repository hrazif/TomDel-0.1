**TomDel** is a database of deleterious mutations in tomato and its closely related populations

Here we provide a database of tomato genes in which deleterious mutations have been detected. We also provide information on genotype frequency of the sites with deleterious muations as well as the ancestral and derived nulecotides and amino acids.

In all pie charts, homoozygous derived (deleterious), heterozygous, and homozygous ancestral genotypes are differentiated in blue, pink, and turquoise, respectively.

Tomato genes in which deleterious muatations were detected can be searched using gene ID, e.g. "Solyc12g100080", from the "Go to file" option
